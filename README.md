A multifaceted DApp on the Steem blockchain to increase development speed for adding features for Steem, currently primarily working on implementing Communities to the Steem blockchain, similar to as discussed in the [hivemind specification](https://github.com/steemit/hivemind/blob/master/docs/communities.md).

Stratos runs on steem-state, a npm package built to make it easy to build soft-consensus DApps on Steem. Any developer can submit an idea, a subapp, etc. and get it added to the Engine network. Currently we're working on creating Communities and in the future NFTs.

The Stratos node contains a CLI and REST API; read more including how to set up a node and how to contribute in the [wiki](https://github.com/stratos-steem/stratos/wiki).
