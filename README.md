A multifaceted DApp on the Steem blockchain to increase development speed for adding features for Steem.

Engine runs on steem-state, a npm package built to make it easy to build soft-consensus DApps on Steem. Any developer can submit an idea, a subapp, etc. and get it added to the Engine network. Currently we're working on creating NFTs and a user-created token system.

The Engine node contains a CLI and REST API; read more including how to set up a node and how to contribute in the wiki.
